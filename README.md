# Koala
A Real-Time Conversation Translator

## What It Does
Koala allows two users to choose their respective languages and then take turns speaking. As each user speaks, the application translates the spoken word from the first user's language into text of the second user's language. This text is then displayed on one half of the screen. Once it is the second user's turn to speak, the application works similarly and outputs the translated text to another half of the screen. This makes communication quick and easy between two completely foreign parties.
